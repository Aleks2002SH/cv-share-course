# MSU Computer Vision Course — Homeworks

This repository contains my homework assignments for the “Introduction to Computer Intelligence. Modern Computer Vision” course at Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU).  

The course provides an introduction to modern computer vision techniques, convolutional and non-convolutional neural networks, PyTorch, object detection, segmentation, generative models, and methods for network acceleration and compression.

## Course Overview

During the course, we explored:

- Classical and modern **computer vision tasks**
- Convolutional layers and non-convolutional layers
- Backpropagation and training neural networks in PyTorch
- Classification architectures and methods for network compression and acceleration
- Object detection and semantic segmentation, including matting
- Image enhancement and generative models for computer vision

## 📚 Homeworks

### Homework 1 — Research Task (CIFAR100)
Task: Train models on the CIFAR100 dataset with a limited number of parameters.  
Objective: Conduct a study and build a parameter-count vs. accuracy curve.  
Requirements:  
- Minimum parameter counts: 1k, 5k, 10k, 50k, 100k, 500k, 1M  
- Training code, model checkpoints, and visualization of results  

Result: Research demonstrating the relationship between model size and classification performance.  

### Homework 2 — [Competition Task](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cv-2025-spring) (Pizza Classification)
Task: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN)** on a labeled pizza image dataset.  
Objective: Apply the trained model to the test set and submit predicted classes.  
Result: End-to-end classification pipeline demonstrating CNN training, evaluation, and inference.
